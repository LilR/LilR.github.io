<p>No comic here, just a random blog!</p>

<p>We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. Your shields were failing, sir. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them.</p>

<p>Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Sorry, Data. Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? I am your worst nightmare! I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? and attack the Romulans. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data?</p>
